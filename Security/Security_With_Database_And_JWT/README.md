# User Roles Table

| Email                      | Password  | Role     |
|----------------------------|----------|----------|
| sean.obrien@hotmail.com    | seanpass | CUSTOMER |
| aoife_murphy78@gmail.com   | aoifepass| ADMIN    |


All user passwords are generated by concatenating the user's first name with the word "pass" (e.g., a user named Sean would have the password "seanpass").
All passwords are hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database.
Currently, only the first two users have been assigned roles:
- sean.obrien@hotmail.com → CUSTOMER
- aoife_murphy78@gmail.com → ADMIN
- All other users have no assigned role by default.


# The relationships between the tables in the `securitydb`

| **Relationships between the tables in the securitydb database** |

## 1. One-to-Many Relationship: `users` → `user_roles`
- The `user_roles` table contains `user_id`, which references `user_id` in the `users` table.
- This means that **a single user can have multiple role assignments**.

## 2. One-to-Many Relationship: `roles` → `user_roles`
- The `user_roles` table contains `role_id`, which references `id` in the `roles` table.
- This means that **a single role can be assigned to multiple users**.

## 3. Many-to-Many Relationship: `users` ↔ `roles` via `user_roles`
- Since `user_roles` connects `users` and `roles`, it forms a **many-to-many** relationship where:
  - A **user** can have **multiple roles**.
  - A **role** can be assigned to **multiple users**.
